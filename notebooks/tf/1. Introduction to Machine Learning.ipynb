    " The real numbers include positive, nagative numbers and zero. They can be of arbitrary precesion meaning they can have any number of decimal points. The set of all real numbers have a standard mathimatical symbol $\\mathbb{R}$. The real numbers can include numbers with infinite precision like:\n",
